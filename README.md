## Usage
Just Imagine that we want to do PEB HOOKING at kernel32.dll with ph_ker32.dll, we have chosen this software poc.exe for the example (allocated in the phook bin\ folder)

Steps:

1.- Execute InjectorDLL specifying a software to execute and the DLL console 
    that will be injected in the process:
        - InjectorDLL.exe console.dll -u poc.exe 

The process will become to a suspend state and there will be a bind socket at 
the port specified at the C:\ph_listen_ports.log  file.
    
        C:\phook\bin>InjectorDll.exe console.dll -u poc.exe

             Try to connect to port written in
             C:\ph_listen_ports.log, syntax: PID-PORT
             Example: nc 127.0.0.1 1234 (1234 is the first default port)


2.-  To connect to the server it is necessary to use a client, similar 
     to netcat, to an open port, in this case 1234.
    
    C:\>nc 127.0.0.1 1234

3.- PEB HOOKING is performed to kernel32.dll with ph_ker32.dll:
    ph > pebhook kernel32.dll C:\phook\bin\windows_xp_sp3\ph_ker32.dll

4.- Resume command is sent to start the execution process:
    
    ph > resume
    ph >    
    C:\phook\bin> 

5.- poc.exe create the files in C:\
    - file
    - file2
    - file3

6.- ph_ker32.dll registers the successful calls to the APIs 
    CreateFileA and CreateFileW [R.14] in file C:\CreateFile.log

7.-
    C:\>more CreateFile.log
    
    C:\file1
    C:\file2
    C:\file3
